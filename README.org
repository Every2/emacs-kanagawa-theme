Palette of Emacs theme in [[https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim][kanagawa.nvim]] isn't 100% aligned with the original Neovim kanagawa theme, thus I adjusted to myself preference. You need to have the =autothemer= package installed.
** Customizations
The theme has some options that can be tweaked via =M-x customize=:
- =kanagawa-theme-comment-italic=
This toggles italics for comments.
- =kanagawa-theme-keyword-italic=
This toggles italics for keywords.
